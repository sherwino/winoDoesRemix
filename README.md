# winoDoesRemix

Just checking out this new framework by brought to you by the team behind React Router, Reach Router, Reach UI, and several other well known libs. 

Here are the [original docs](./docs/remix.md)

Now I am kind of just following a random tutorial to see how it goes, but already looks like we have some surprises. The guide I am following is using tailwind, and some other libs that I haven't really used that much so here goes.

## Hosting

At the moment the biggest question for me is what is required to host these projects. The Remix team is using their own server for hosting, and want to offer a cloud service.

### Static assets and build folders

Right now I am gitignore-ing all of the build files because I don't want to upload this stuff yet, but it seems like I could just build a static version and just host that on any CDN... not 100% yet.
